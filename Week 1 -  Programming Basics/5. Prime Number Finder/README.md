## How It Works

The program uses two different methods to find prime numbers:

1. **Trial Division Method**
   - Used for checking individual numbers and small ranges
   - Divides the number by potential factors up to its square root
   - Efficient for small numbers and ranges

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**
   - Used automatically for ranges larger than 1000 numbers
   - More efficient for generating large sets of prime numbers
   - Implements the classical sieve algorithm

Additional features:
- Automatic range sorting if start > end
- Visual warning for large visualization ranges
- Prime number count display
- Input validation and error handling

## Contributing
